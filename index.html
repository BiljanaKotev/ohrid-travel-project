        <h2>WHY OHRID?</h2>
        <h3>Ohrid, the city of churches</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the large number of churches and monasteries, the city of Ohrid
          is known as Balkan and European Jerusalem. It is also known as the
          "City of Light", a literal translation of its old name, Lychnidos. The
          Ohrid region is included in the UNESCO World Heritage. According to
          one legend, written by the Miladinov Brothers, when the Ohrid fortress
          was made, Emperor Justinian climbed the hills on which the city lies,
          and, looking at the beautiful surroundings, exclaimed "oh-hill", which
          means - a beautiful hill. Since then, the city is called Ohrid. Modern
          Ohrid is the heir of the ancient Lychnidos. According to the data, the
          city was first mentioned 2,400 years before the new era. Lihnidos was
          on the Via Egnatia road, the oldest and most significant Roman traffic
          route in the Balkans.
